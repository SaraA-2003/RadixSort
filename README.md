# Radix Sort with Doubly Linked List

## Project Overview
This project implements an application that sorts strings using **Radix Sort** with a **Doubly Linked List** structure. It is written in C and provides a menu-driven interface for users to load, sort, modify, and save a list of words.


## Features
- Load strings from an input file
- Display strings before sorting
- Sort strings using Radix Sort
- Display sorted strings
- Add a new word to the sorted list and re-sort
- Delete a word from the list
- Save the sorted list to an output file
- Exit the program

## Technologies Used
